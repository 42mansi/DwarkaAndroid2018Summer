# Coding Blocks Homework Repository : Make Code Great Again!
A place where EveryOne will be adding their code

---

## What the hell just happenned? That's not the code we did in class?!  
Nothing Bad,Don't Worry . I just cleaned the code.Your machine , won't blow up, I Promise :smile:    
All your PR attempts during the class has been merged  and they are present inside the  **(Git_Session)[www.google.com]** folder.  

## Grr,  But it did. Just tell me quick, what to do!

 *  **Short-term, Bad hack** :
	* go to your profile page on github.com  
	* go to `your`  DwarkaAndroid2018Summer repo under the `repository`  button
	* settings > delete this archive (in the bottom) [ **Warning** : this will also delete 
	   all the offline changes and would cause error in your local repository    
	* `Fork` the  DwarkaAndroid2018Summer  repo again.    

 * **Long-Term, Good method** :    

	1.  **Sync CodingBlock's Repository with your `Online`  repository**.  : `make a Pull Request1`      
		(Where? on your  forked repository, _ there will be a line saying this branch is x commits behind main branch_ . the button is right there    
	2. **Sync your `Online` Repository with your  `Offline` Copy**  :    
		1. go inside your  `local/offline` copy. open  `bash` here .   
		2.  `git pull`

## Meh,Ok . What's with this `Ansh_Sachdeva` and Where are the other Github session Related Files?  
	*  `Git_Session` You will find all the github related content(+more) in today's Session Here    

	*  `Ansh_Sachdeva` : this is a Sample Repo . like which you will be creating Projects. From now On You will be  creating
	     a Repo of `Your_Name` just like this, and submit each week's challange inside that folder only. * **Note** :As discussed,
	     Information related UI challange app that I showed in the class will be posted here by 21.6.18 mid night. Do keep a check :P*
